## üéØ What is Zista?

**Zista is an all-in-one web application (PWA) that empowers Kenyan youth to access daily tools, learn valuable skills, play engaging games, and shop from a curated marketplace‚Äîall while earning rewards through a unique Honey points system.**

Think of it as: **"The Swiss Army Knife App for Productive Youth"**

- Local e-commerce doesn't cater to youth needs

**The Frustration:**
"I need to download an Instagram video ‚Üí Google 'IG downloader' ‚Üí Click sketchy site ‚Üí Deal with popup ads ‚Üí Download fails ‚Üí Try another site ‚Üí Repeat..."
