## 🚧 KNOWN LIMITATIONS (MVP Scope)

**What's intentionally missing:**
- No learning courses yet
- No games yet
- No marketplace yet
- No community features yet
- No real money transactions
- No mobile apps (PWA only)
- Basic AI features only
- Limited tool customization

**Why that's OK:**
- Proves core concept (tools + rewards)
- Fast to build and launch
- Easy to gather feedback
- Clear path to expansion
- Lower maintenance burden

---

## 🎯 DECISION POINTS

### **Should You Add Learning in MVP?**

**Add if:**
- You have 3-5 book summaries ready
- You want to test learning engagement early
- You have extra time (1-2 weeks)

**Skip if:**
- Tools alone provide enough value
- You want faster launch
- You want to focus on tool quality

**Recommendation:** Skip for MVP, add in Week 7-8 after beta feedback.

---

### **Should You Build Mobile Apps?**

**Add if:**
- You know React Native
- You want app store presence
- Users demand it

**Skip if:**
- PWA works well on mobile
- You want faster launch
- You're solo developer

**Recommendation:** Skip for MVP, PWA is enough. Build native apps in Phase 3.

---

### **Should You Monetize in MVP?**

**Add if:**
- Ads are integrated (rewarded videos)
- You want early revenue
- You have 500+ users

**Skip if:**
- Focus is on user growth
- Want to perfect product first
- Under 100 users

**Recommendation:** Rewarded ads OK in MVP (users earn Honey). Skip marketplace monetization until Phase 2.
