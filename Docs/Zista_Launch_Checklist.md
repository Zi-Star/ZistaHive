   - Open Vercel project
   - Check deployment logs
   - Look for errors

4. **Communicate**
   - Post in beta group: "We're aware of the issue, investigating"

---

### **If Database Issues**

   - How many users affected?

3. **Fix immediately**
   - Deploy fix ASAP
   - Test thoroughly

4. **Disclose appropriately**
   - If data was exposed: Email all users
   - If just a potential issue: Fix quietly, monitor
