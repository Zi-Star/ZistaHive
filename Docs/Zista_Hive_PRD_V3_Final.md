ZISTA HIVE SYSTEM — PRD V3 (Final)
“Stay Busy. Stay Smart.”  — Powered by Z-Star

1. Vision Overview
Zista is an intelligent digital ecosystem that mirrors the dynamics of a bee colony. Every “Bee” (user) contributes to a living hive through activity, creativity, and collaboration. The Hive thrives on daily cycles of learning, working, sharing, and earning.

Mission: Provide one web-based platform (PWA-ready) for Kenyan youth to Learn, Create, Connect, and Earn.
2. Brand & Identity
• App Name: Zista (App) — Parent Brand: Z-Star

• Main Motto: Stay Busy. Stay Smart.  • Parent Motto: Life in Motion

• Symbolism: Bee (productivity) + Star (guidance)

• Tone: Youthful, empowering, mildly local (light Swahili where appropriate), visionary.

3. Design System Foundations
Framework & Tools:
• Frontend: Next.js 14 + React + TypeScript

• Styling: TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui

• Component Library: Zista-UI (shared at /shared/) — Storybook for previews

• Motion: Framer Motion for subtle transitions

• Typography: Rounded & friendly — Poppins or Inter

Color Palette (confirmed):
• Golden Honey — #F9C74F (warmth, productivity)

• Deep Indigo — #312E81 (depth, knowledge)

• Soft White — #F5F5F7 (balance)

• Accent Cyan — #3ABFF8 (freshness)

Design Notes:
• UI components in /shared/ (Zista-UI) with strict contracts and variant props.

• Use Storybook to preview, test, and iterate components.

• Follow accessible contrast ratios and responsive patterns (mobile-first).

• Motion should be subtle and purposeful; avoid heavy transitions on critical flows.

4. Hive Architecture & Tech Stack (Self-hosted Web App)
High-level Architecture:
• Web App (PWA-ready) built with Next.js 14. Server-side rendering for SEO and faster initial loads. Client-side interactivity for tools and community features.

• Backend: Node.js (Express / Next API Routes) — modular service architecture.

• Database: PostgreSQL (preferred). Use Prisma ORM for typesafety and migrations.

• File Storage: S3-compatible (Cloudflare R2 or MinIO) or self-hosted file server.

• Real-time: Socket.io or Pusher for Colony realtime updates (chat, notifications).

• CI/CD & Hosting: Dockerized services, deploy to a VPS or managed provider (DigitalOcean / Render). Use GitHub Actions for CI.

• Monitoring & Observability: Sentry (error tracking), Prometheus + Grafana (metrics), BeeTrace (custom admin analytics dashboard).

5. Hive Terminology (System Naming & Mapping)
The product will use bee-themed naming across features and UI to maintain brand unity and engagement. Each term is mapped to a functional area.

10. Code Structure, Modularity & Developer Practices
Project Structure (recommended):
• /apps/web — Next.js frontend (pages/app routes, components, styles)

• /apps/api — Next API routes or separate Node service

• /packages/shared — Zista-UI (components, hooks, utilities) — consumed by web and any micro apps

• /packages/tools/{tool-name} — each tool is a standalone package/module (Combs). Example: /packages/tools/qr-generator

• /packages/services — integrations (payments, notifications, AI adaptors)

• /infra — Docker, k8s manifests, deployment scripts

Code Practices & Guidelines:
- Each tool as its own directory/module with its own tests and README.

- Cross-sharing: All shared logic and UI lives in /packages/shared; use clear API surface.

- Use TypeScript across frontend and backend; validate with Zod on API boundaries.

- Storybook for components; unit tests with Jest; E2E with Playwright.
